Since the emergence of Network Science one of the most interesting research questions was: How the influence spread through the network of social interactions? For the last 10-15 years, thanks to faster and faster technology development (especially IT) we can finally record and analyse real world spreading processes. Based on the analysis of recorded data, scientist found out two important things. Firstly, existing spreading models rarely can explain what we observe in the real data. Secondly, simple monoplex network and its models are a poor representation of the complex interaction between people. The first finding led to the research on new spreading models or further development of the old ones, so they can better explain what we can observe in real data. Out of the second finding, two branches of network science evolved. The first one is temporal (dynamic) network and the second one is multilayer network. During last few years researchers are trying to merge the new network representations with spreading models. More advanced research revolves around temporal networks since, as dynamic models, they seem to be more capable to fully represent the dynamic of interaction and in consequence the dynamic of the spreading process. Much later the new area of spreading phenomena in multilayer networks emerged. It is much harder to model the network dynamics using multilayer network (but not impossible). However, those networks are much better in reflecting the complex interaction between different networks, people activities in different environments and might help to understand how influence is spreading through multiple interconnected complex systems. Unfortunately, initial observation proved that methods developed for monoplex networks often do not work in multilayer networks. Even well-established and quite simple models for monoplex networks are not easy to generalise for multilayer networks. Moreover, new problems, not existing for monoplex networks emerged, for example, the layer switching cost. Finally, there is no research done or real network with real spreading processes on it. Thus, this project will try to tackle the problem of spreading in multilayer networks with the main focus on social influence and the main objective is to understand and quantify the mechanisms behind the spread of influence in real multilayer social networks.
